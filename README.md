# sweetPotet.mp3
### It's listenable.
sweetPotet.mp3 is a simple digital audio media player imlpemented using the STM32F072RB MCU and the AK4432VT DAC. It should be able to (at least I hope) load mp3 files from a SD card and decode them to PCM streams which then is converted by the AK4432. The final amplification is done by two good ol' NE5532s.  
### If You Expected Hi-Fi, You Are at the Wrong Place.
This project is not intended to create anything fancy. As the name suggests, it's a complete potet; however, it won't disappoint either, because it's just ok.
